# Online-Phone-Store
Using MongoDB I made a Mobile Phone store which takes users data and saves it onto the website for each phone order that is made. I used the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) method as my main approach for this project. The website allows for users to make orders and input their info for deliveries. Using PHP,HTML was awesome.
